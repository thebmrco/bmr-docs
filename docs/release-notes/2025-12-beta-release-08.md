A completely new **Acoustic Flow** has been introduced to guide users step by step through acoustic assessment of a room.

The flow is designed to be **guided, repeatable, and easy to understand**, helping users perform reliable acoustic measurements directly in the app.

### Step-by-step Acoustic Flow

#### 1. Room Setup & Measurement Guidance
Users are guided on how to position the phone and speaker correctly before starting the measurement.

#### 3. Volume Adjustment & Validation
Users are guided to adjust speaker volume to the recommended level.  
The app validates the difference between ambient noise and speaker level before allowing the measurement to continue.

#### 4. Measurement Preparation
Clear instructions ensure users remain still and quiet during the measurement to guarantee accurate results.

After completion, users receive:
- A **MOS (Mean Opinion Score)**  
- An acoustic summary (e.g. RT60)  
- Frequency-based measurement graphs  

This makes it easy to understand room acoustic quality at a glance.

# Welcome to Better Meeting Rooms

**Better Meeting Rooms** is a platform that helps organizations plan, design, and manage high-performing meeting rooms. Our app supports the full lifecycle of a meeting space — from the first scan to long-term maintenance.

## What We Offer

We guide you through the **four key phases** of meeting room projects:

### Discovery  
Capture and understand the current state of the room using scans, photos, and documentation. Measure acoustics, identify challenges, and gather all relevant data — whether the room exists or is still in planning.

### Design  
Use the collected data to generate optimized room layouts. Create AR-based mockups, get auto-generated suggestions, or request professional design options — always based on real conditions and best practices.

### Deployment  
Turn approved designs into action. Access complete installation details, equipment lists, and cabling diagrams. Reduce delays and confusion by ensuring every stakeholder has exactly what they need.

### Maintenance  
Keep rooms performing long after installation. Monitor key components, support troubleshooting, and request room updates based on usage or feedback — all connected to the room’s original context.

## Best Practices Built In

Throughout the platform, we embed expert insights on:

- **Acoustics** – Optimize for clarity, reduce noise, and boost speech intelligibility  
- **Lighting** – Ensure well-lit environments for both video and in-person meetings  
- **Technology** – Select the right AV gear and collaboration tools  
- **Furniture** – Choose ergonomic, functional setups  
- **Layout** – Design spaces that enable better interaction and communication  

You’ll also find **practical guides and templates** for every phase of the room lifecycle.

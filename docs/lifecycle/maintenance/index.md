#  Maintenance Phase

The **Maintenance Phase** ensures that rooms remain effective and reliable after deployment.  
It builds on the Discovery and Design data captured earlier, providing a foundation for troubleshooting, upgrades, and lifecycle management.

---

## Current Scope

At this stage, Maintenance is primarily supported by the information collected during **Discovery** and **Design**, including:

- **Digital twin** of the room (scan + markers)  
- **Equipment list** associated with the latest design  
- **Acoustic measurements** and recommendations  
- **Room history** (activities, updates, approvals)  

This ensures that support teams and facility managers have a single source of truth about the room.

## Roadmap

Future Maintenance features will expand to include:

- **Live integration** with external platforms 
- **Automated status monitoring** of installed devices  
- **Troubleshooting workflows** directly linked to the roomâ€™s data  
- **Upgrade requests** to initiate new Discovery/Design cycles  
- **Lifecycle analytics** to track performance and usage over time

## Outputs of Maintenance

- Centralised **room record** with all data accessible  
- Faster **troubleshooting** and reduced downtime  
- A clear path for **room upgrades** and continuous improvement

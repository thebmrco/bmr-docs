# 🔎 Discovery Phase

The **Discovery Phase** is the first and most important step in the Better Meeting Rooms lifecycle.  
During Discovery, you capture accurate data about your meeting room, which becomes the foundation for design and deployment.

## 🛰️ Room Scanning

Use your iPhone or iPad (with LiDAR) to create a **digital twin** of the room.

1. Open the app and select **Start Scan**  
2. Move your device slowly around the room until all walls and surfaces are captured  
3. Save the scan – it will appear in the **Scan Library**

1. While scanning, tap **Camera buttonr**  
2. An image is taken of the area, and saved as a marker

## 🔊 Acoustic Measurement

Capture the **acoustic profile** of your room.  

- **Speaker Test**: Play a test sound and capture detail reverberation and sound propagation data.
- **Balloon Pop**: Use a balloon to capture RT60 (reverberation time)  (BETA)

All acoustic measurements are stored in the **Acoustics Library**.

## ✅ Outputs of Discovery

After completing Discovery, you will have:  
- A **digital twin** of the room  
- Marker data (outlets, devices, furniture, etc)  
- Acoustic measurements  
- Optional uploaded schematics/drawings  

This data flows into the **Design Phase** for creating layouts, equipment lists, and collaboration experiences.

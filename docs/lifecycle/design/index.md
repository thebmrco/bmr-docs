# Design Phase

The **Design Phase** turns room data into a proposed setup ready for deployment.  
Designs are based on:
- The **scan** (digital twin)
- **Markers** (photos & notes of key elements)
- **Acoustic measurements** (highly recommended)
- **User requirements** (use case, capacity, preferences)

You can create a design in two ways:

---

## 1) AR Design (Self‑Service)

Create a design yourself while you’re in the room.

**How it works**
1. Open the room in the iOS app and choose **AR Design**.
2. Pick items from the **Equipment Catalog** (cameras, screens, mics, speakers, furniture, etc.).
3. Place, rotate, and align 3D models in the scanned space.
4. Save the **configuration** to the room.

**What you get**
- Saved **AR layout** with placed items  
- Auto‑generated **equipment list** (based on placed models)  
- Option to request a BMR review later

> Tip: Run (or upload) **acoustic measurements** first—placement decisions get much easier.

---

## 2) Design Request (Prepared by BMR)

Request a BMR‑authored design via the **web**.

**How it works**
1. Open the room on the web and click **Request Design**.
2. Complete the **questionnaire** (capacity, seating style, content sharing, VC platform, screens, audio needs, constraints).
3. Submit. BMR uses your **scan, markers, acoustics**, and **answers** to produce a design.

**What you get**
- **Design package** uploaded to the room  
- **Equipment list** with key components  
- **Acoustic recommendation** (treatment type & quantity)  
- Visuals such as **camera view**, **audio coverage**, and **screen visibility** (where available)

---

## Reviewing a Design

1. Open the room’s **Library** to view available designs.  
2. Inspect coverage visuals and the **equipment list**.  
3. Add comments or request adjustments.  
4. **Approve** when ready to move into Deployment.

---

## Outputs of the Design Phase

- One or more **approved designs** per room  
- A consolidated **equipment list** for procurement  
- **Acoustic recommendation** based on measurements and use case  
- A **review/approval trail** tied to the room

---

## Prerequisites & Best Practices

- ✅ Completed **scan** and **markers**  
- ✅ **Acoustic measurement** uploaded (recommended)  
- ✅ Clear **requirements** via the design questionnaire (if using Design Request)  

> The better the Discovery data, the faster the Design—and the fewer changes later.

# Deployment Phase

The **Deployment Phase** is where approved designs turn into real meeting rooms.  
At this stage, the goal is to ensure that every piece of equipment is installed correctly, following the agreed design.

---

## Current Scope

Today, Deployment provides:
- **Approved designs** uploaded to the room
- **Equipment list** with all required devices and materials

This ensures that partners and installers have the **full bill of materials** needed to order and set up the room.

---

## Roadmap

Over the coming releases, Deployment will expand with:
- **Installation guides** generated per room
- **Checklists** for structured installation and quality assurance
- **Integration** with external service platforms (e.g., ServiceNow, Webex Control Hub)
- **Progress tracking** during installation
- **Handover process** into Maintenance

---

## Outputs of Deployment

- Confirmed **installation package** (design + equipment list)
- A starting point for the **Maintenance Phase**
